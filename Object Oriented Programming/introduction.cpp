/*
    Object Oriented Programming is a programming style that is intended
    to make thinking about programming closer to thinking about the real world.
    In programming, objects are independent units, and each has its own identity,
    just as objects in the real world do.

    An apple is an object; so is a mug. Each has its unique identity.
    It's possible to have two mugs that look identical, but they are still separate, unique objects.
